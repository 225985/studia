WARNING:Cpld - Unable to retrieve the path to the iSE Project Repository. Will
   use the default filename of 'lab4.ise'.
INFO:Cpld - Inferring BUFG constraint for signal 'CLR' based upon the LOC
   constraint 'P43'. It is recommended that you declare this BUFG explicitedly
   in your design. Note that for certain device families the output of a BUFG
   constraint can not drive a gated clock, and the BUFG constraint will be
   ignored.
WARNING:Cpld:1239 - The global clock designation (BUFG) on signal 'CLR_IBUF' is
   ignored. Most likely the signal is gated and therefore cannot be used as a
   global control signal.
ERROR:Cpld - Pin constraints not supported in autofit mode. Either specify a
   package or remove pin constraints.
ERROR:Cpld - The design requires too many resources to fit in any of the
   specified devices or design rule checks prevent this design from fitting.
ERROR:Cpld:868 - Cannot fit the design into any of the specified devices with
   the selected implementation options.
